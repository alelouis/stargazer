# Stargazer

## Objectives
**I am building a star explorer application : Stargazer.**

This project serves as a proxy for me to get better at:
- Rust
- ECS based architecture (with Bevy)
- Basic 3D engine manipulations (proj matrices, quaternions, transforms..)
- Astronomy fancy details


------------

## Status
Stargazer is in early development (started early September 2021). The current envisioned features implemented/to be impleted are listed below.

## Done
- [x] Custom 3D to 2D projection
- [x] Equatorial grid render from paths
- [x] Constellation render from file

## To Do (not in order)
- [ ] Camera movement from mouse
- [ ] Align 3D world coordinates to RA/DEC and cardinal points
- [ ] RA/DEC star coordinate fetching from Some(api)
- [ ] Aesthetic concerns
- [ ] Multiple states (menu, config, etc...)
